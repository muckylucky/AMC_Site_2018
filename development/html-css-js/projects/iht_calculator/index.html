                    <p>But it is also important to think ahead so you can protect your estate against IHT both now and in the future as your wealth grows. To future proof your IHT plans there are a number of things you could do:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Increase the Whole of Life Cover you buy from the start</li>
                        <li>Regularly review your cover needs with your financial adviser</li>
                        <li>Add indexation to your Whole of Life cover so your cover could be more likely to track your IHT bill in the future</li>
                    </ol>

    <h3>Nil-rate band</h3>
    <p>The nil-rate band is the amount below which your estate will not pay any inheritance tax, and is currently set at £325,000 for individuals (frozen until April 2018). Any large gifts that you have made over £3000 will stay ‘on the clock’ for seven years and effectively reduce your available nil rate band during this period.</p>
    <p>Any estate will then be charged inheritance tax at a rate of 40% on all taxable assets above this amount. E.g. If your estate is worth £400,000, you will pay £40% tax on the £75,000 (=£400,000-£325,000) that is above your nil-rate band. So in this case, £30,000 (=£75,000 x 40%)will be paid in inheritance tax.</p>

    <p>If you leave all of your wealth to your spouse or Registered Civil Partner (RCP), then providing they are UK domiciled there  will be no inheritance tax is payable. A lower spouse exemption applies to gifts to non UK domiciled spouses. Using the spouse exemption  means that some or all of your individual nil-rate allowance is un-used. HMRC allow you to transfer any unused nil-rate allowance to a spouse or RCP, so on current rates this means that when they die their nil-rate band could potentially be £650,000.</p>
    <p>Leaving assets to unmarried partners or children does not qualify for any IHT relief.</p>

    <p>Please note that you should always seek advice when calculating how much your nil-rate band is, as it may vary depending on your individual circumstances and plans for your estate.</p>

    <h3>Leaving money to charity</h3>
    <p>If you opt to leave more than 10% of your 'baseline' estate to charity, then HMRC will reduce the inheritance tax rate it will charge your estate from 40% to 36%. 'Baseline' estate is the value of your estate remaining after deducting your nil-rate band. So if you have an estate of £500,000 and a nil-rate band of £325,000, then your baseline estate will be £175,000. Normally the inheritance tax bill will be £70,000 (=£175,000 x 40%).</p>

    <p>If however you opt to give 10% or more of your 'baseline' estate to charity, then your IHT rate will fall to 36%. That means at least a £17,500 donation to charity in this case. By applying 36% to your residual estate, after deducting both the nil-rate band and charity donation, then in this case the IHT bill will be £56,700 (= £500,000 - £325,000 - £17,500 = £157,500 x 36%). That's a reduction in the IHT bill of £13,300.</p>
	<p>If you select the option to leave at least 10% of your estate to charity, the calculator will work out how much inheritance tax you will pay assuming you give 10% of your 'baseline' estate to charity.</p>
    <p>Please note that you should always seek advice when calculating how much your inheritance tax rate is, as it may vary depending on your individual circumstances and plans for your estate.</p>

	<h3>OTHER ASSUMPTIONS WE HAVE MADE</h3>
    <p>Here are some other things we have <strong>not</strong> taken into account in these illustrations:</p>
	<ol>
	    <li>Any change in your wealth due to future earnings or capital spending.</li>
	    <li>Any existing protection policies you may have in place and that are not in trust may be classified as part of your estate for IHT purposes. You may wish to include the value of these existing policies in your &ldquo;other&rdquo; assets category, as these may add to your IHT bill.</li>
	    <li>Any tax planning you may have already done or might consider doing, in particular the existence of trusts that may change your ultimate IHT bill. You may wish to exclude the value of any assets that you have placed in trust and that you believe are no longer subject to IHT. </li>
	    <li>Any future changes in the prevailing taxation regime, in particular changes to the inheritance tax rates or the nil-rate bands.</li>
	    <li>We have also assumed your pensions are not subject to IHT. However many pensions can be  subject to IHT depending on the circumstances. You may wish to include the value of your pensions if you believe they will be included as part of your estate for IHT purposes. Note that where pension benefits are left to dependents other taxes may apply instead of IHT.</li>
	    <li>We have assumed any business assets fall outside of your estate. You should seek advice on the extent to which any business relief could apply to your business.</li>
